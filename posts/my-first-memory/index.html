			<p><em>The Writing Life</em> by Annie Dillard, <em>Bird by Bird</em> by Anne Lamott, <em>These Precious Days</em> by Ann Patchett, and, in breaking with the Ann(i)(e) theme, <em>One Long River of Song</em> by Brian Doyle. Brian does end with &ldquo;an&rdquo; though and if we went from Annie-&gt;Anne-&gt;Ann then the next logical name would be An. Anyway, that's not why I called. If I could wave a magic wand and write like someone, it would be one of those four.</p>
<p>In <em>Bird by Bird</em> Lamott provides aspiring writers, or people that post dumb things on their website named after something Opie said in an episode of <em>The Andy Griffith Show</em>, with ideas about what to write about. As I read her book, I wrote down things I thought maybe I could write about. I thought I'd start at the beginning with my first memory&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p>I walked out the door. Two doors if you count the screen door. I wonder if they make screen doors like that anymore. Top half screen, bottom half white metal about as thick as a Coke can. No local Lowe's or Home Depot then. Where would you go to get a screen door in the early 80s? Sears? I can't think of Sears without thinking of Grandma saying, when talking about her grandparents house, &ldquo;And we had a Sears Roebuck catalog in the outhouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a rectangular house, barely more than a thousand square feet, with a one car garage on the right side, the front door just to the left of the garage. A decent size maple tree in the front yard. A backyard perfect for 1 on 1 baseball games. For a long time the only air conditioning was a window unit in my parent's bedroom. The door was always closed to keep the cold air in. After school I'd stand in there for a second, hair blowing in the window unit AC breeze, and think, &ldquo;I bet George Steinbrenner has air conditioning in his entire house.&rdquo; I didn't actually think about George Steinbrenner. When was the last time you thought about ? What about Marge Schott? It's probably been a while.</p>
<p>Back to the garage door for a second. It was not automatic. You had to open it the old fashioned way. My grandparents, however, had a garage door opener. My older brother and I were inside and opened the door. He successfully grabbed onto the handle and took a ride, successfully landing on his two feet after the mission. Monkey see, monkey do. I held on and then smashed my face on the ground.</p>
<p>So, as I was saying, I walked out the door, strode down the driveway and walked right into the road. At least I think I made it to the road. Someone, maybe my mom, stopped me and asked what I was doing. That's it. My first memory. I wanted to see what the road was all about.</p>
<hr>
<p>Somewhere Anne Lamott is sorry for what she's done. Or she should be.</p>
