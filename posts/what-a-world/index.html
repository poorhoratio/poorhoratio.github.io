			<p>&ldquo;What a world, to have sparrows in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That's a line in Brian Doyle's <em>A Book of Uncommon Prayer: 100 Celebrations of the Miracle &amp; Muddle of the Ordinary</em>.</p>
<p>The math doesn't add up, but my favorite chapter title in that book is probably, &ldquo;Prayer for the Elderly Woman on the Train Eating One Almond Every Five Minutes for Two Hours for a Grand Total of Forty Almonds and Believe Me I Counted, Fascinated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have yet to count the number of almonds a stranger is eating on a train, though I might if the opportunity presents itself, but I have made an effort to see something and think to myself, &ldquo;What a world, to have ________ in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doyle is exceptionally good at reminding me to appreciate all that life has to offer. With that in mind:</p>
<p>What a world, to have&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;a great-uncle that I hadn't seen in over a decade and was able to spend time with and look at old family photos with</p>
<p>&hellip;cousins that I hadn't seen in even longer than that</p>
<p>&hellip;koi ponds and fish water pitchers and 1913 Edison phonographs</p>
<p>&hellip;an important person to me that fended off cancer in a way that makes me hope I could have that kind of strength and spirit under such trying circumstances</p>
<p>&hellip;high school friends that I hadn't seen in over 25 years and on one hand it felt even longer than that, but on the other it felt like yesterday and I hope I see them again before another quarter of a century passes</p>
<p>&hellip;laughing children</p>
<p>&hellip;whippoorwills that sing their song at 3am when you're outside because you thought it was a good idea to get a dog a few years ago and now the dog is outside at 3am eating grass and the dog can be forgiven if there is a whippoorwill to keep me company</p>
<p>&hellip;the sound of a Hammond B3 organ</p>
<p>&hellip;the morning sun casting its light on my wife's face</p>
<p>&hellip;canned bread, I don't quite understand why you would put bread in a can, but I like that someone thought outside of the bread bag and they they used their genius to put bread in a can instead of for evil</p>
<p>&hellip;in it.</p>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Do we ever stop and pray enough for the wealth of small things that are not small at all? We do not. But we do now.&rdquo;</p>
