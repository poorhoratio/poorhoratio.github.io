      <description>Finally finished The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I read the Pevear translation. It took forever. That was a long book.
 The Good
The Pevear translation seems to be regarded as the most true to the original. I have no idea if that is true or not, I don&#39;t read Russian. The story is intriguing, the characters are complex, and it makes you think.
 The Bad
This was a tough read.</description>
