      <description>“Grandma is gone”
That’s what the text said anyway. Truth be told, she had been gone at least a little while. And on the slow, sad road longer than that. A few years ago, or maybe it was more, I really don’t remember, she was in the hospital and as I walk in to her room she greets me, “Hello Nick-a-roo.”
That is the last time I remember her remembering me.</description>

      <title>Quick Book Review - The Brothers Karamazov</title>
      <link>/2017/03/05/the-brothers-karamazov/</link>

      <description>Finally finished The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I read the Pevear translation. It took forever. That was a long book.
The Good
The Pevear translation seems to be regarded as the most true to the original. I have no idea if that is true or not, I don&amp;rsquo;t read Russian. The story is intriguing, the characters are complex, and it makes you think.
The Bad
This was a tough read.</description>

      <title>How I Met My Wife at Arby&#39;s</title>

      <description>At work there is a group that puts on fun events for our team called the Fun Police. For Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day I wrote about how I met my wife. I had fun writing it up and thought I would share it here. Feel free to use it as a guide to meeting your own wife at Arby&amp;rsquo;s.
Our Arby&amp;rsquo;s sign didn&amp;rsquo;t look like this one, but it should have.
Let’s turn back the clock to August 1995&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Quick Book Review - The Gift of Failure</title>

      <description>Finished The Gift of Failure: How the Best Parents Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed by Jessica Lahey.
The Good
I need daily, maybe hourly, reminders when it comes to parenting. I try to be patient, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard. There is a lot of good advice in here. It boils down to not doing everything for your kids. Let them fail. Let them learn from those failures. Probably good advice for adults too.</description>

      <title>Quick Book Review - The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds</title>

      <description>Finished The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds by Michael Lewis today. Not as good as I hoped.
The Good
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky had an amazing relationship and it was fascinating to read about. I read Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s Thinking, Fast and Slow a few years ago so I was really looking forward to this book. On top of that I&amp;rsquo;ve a couple of other books by Lewis and always enjoyed them.</description>

      <title>Quick Book Review - The Things They Carried</title>
      <link>/2017/01/08/the-things-they-carried/</link>

      <description>The Good - Superb writing. It made me think - a lot. More than just about war.
The Bad - I tend to be a non-fiction reader. Maybe it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if any of what he wrote really happened, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I would like to have known what was real and what wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Guess it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
Verdict - 4 stars
Perhaps because it&amp;rsquo;s the last story and what&amp;rsquo;s closest to my mind now that I&amp;rsquo;ve finished the book, but it made me think about my friend Justin.</description>

      <title>Quick Book Review - 10% Happier</title>
      <link>/2017/01/05/10-percent-happier/</link>

      <guid>/2017/01/05/10-percent-happier/</guid>
      <description>Just finished 10% Happier by Dan Harris. I give it 3.5 stars, I guess. I rounded down on Goodreads and gave it 3.
The Good - I like personal stories, hearing about individuals personal struggles, how they overcome them, and how they have found ways to be a better person. As a parent I could use more mindfulness. A lot more mindfulness. It&amp;rsquo;s a struggle. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll start meditating. Anything I can do to help me reason instead of react is a good thing.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I started reading a lot more and keeping track of what I&amp;rsquo;m reading. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Goodreads. Anyway, something else I like are &amp;ldquo;best books I read this year (or last, as it were)&amp;rdquo; lists. So here is mine, in no particular order, except my favorite is first.
 Shoe Dog by Phil Knight  Fantastic book about the beginning of Nike. I don&amp;rsquo;t care much about shoes, but I remember having Nike shoes in elementary school.</description>
