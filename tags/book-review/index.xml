      <description>Finished The Gift of Failure: How the Best Parents Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed by Jessica Lahey.
The Good
I need daily, maybe hourly, reminders when it comes to parenting. I try to be patient, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard. There is a lot of good advice in here. It boils down to not doing everything for your kids. Let them fail. Let them learn from those failures. Probably good advice for adults too.</description>

      <description>Finished The Undoing Project: A Friendship That Changed Our Minds by Michael Lewis today. Not as good as I hoped.
The Good
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky had an amazing relationship and it was fascinating to read about. I read Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s Thinking, Fast and Slow a few years ago so I was really looking forward to this book. On top of that I&amp;rsquo;ve a couple of other books by Lewis and always enjoyed them.</description>

      <title>Quick Book Review - The Things They Carried</title>
      <link>/2017/01/08/the-things-they-carried/</link>

      <description>The Good - Superb writing. It made me think - a lot. More than just about war.
The Bad - I tend to be a non-fiction reader. Maybe it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if any of what he wrote really happened, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I would like to have known what was real and what wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Guess it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.
Verdict - 4 stars
Perhaps because it&amp;rsquo;s the last story and what&amp;rsquo;s closest to my mind now that I&amp;rsquo;ve finished the book, but it made me think about my friend Justin.</description>

      <title>Quick Book Review - 10% Happier</title>
      <link>/2017/01/05/10-percent-happier/</link>

      <description>Just finished 10% Happier by Dan Harris. I give it 3.5 stars, I guess. I rounded down on Goodreads and gave it 3.
The Good - I like personal stories, hearing about individuals personal struggles, how they overcome them, and how they have found ways to be a better person. As a parent I could use more mindfulness. A lot more mindfulness. It&amp;rsquo;s a struggle. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll start meditating. Anything I can do to help me reason instead of react is a good thing.</description>
